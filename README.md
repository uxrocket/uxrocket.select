UX Rocket Select
===============
UX Rocket Select plugin is designed for styling and enhancing the user experience capabilities of native html select. You can search, select multiple options, limit max selection in multiple selects etc. It is also easily themable. By default, its styles only defined for properly working. You need minimum amount of overwrite for defining your own theme for the select.

## Install
Select can directly install your project by copying the contents of `dist` folder to your assets, and [npm](https://www.npmjs.org/) or [bower](http://bower.io/) packages. All dependent libraries will also installed with the packages. Just run, with npm;

```
npm install uxrocket.select
```

or with Bower

```
bower install uxrocket.select
```

Then, import files to your HTML

```HTML
<link rel="stylesheet" href="<path-to-bower_components>/uxrocket.select/dist/uxrocket.select.min.css" />

<script src="<path-to-jquery"></script>
<script src="<path-to-bower_components>/uxrocket.factory/dist/uxrocket.factory.min.js"></script>
<script src="<path-to-bower_components>/uxrocket.select/dist/uxrocket.select.min.js"></script>
<script>
    $(function(){
        $('.select').select(); // for default settings
    });
</script>
```
_if you want to use plugin in development mode, you can `import` `_uxrocket-select.scss` file under `<path-to-bower_components>/uxrocket.select/lib/` to your Sass_

Select plugin is designed to enhance native select, so in your HTML, you only need to have a normal select to bind the plugin.

```HTML
<select class="select">
    <option value="">Please select one</option>
    <option value="1">Option 1</option>
    <option value="2">Option 2</option>
    <option value="3">Option 3</option>
    <option value="4">Option 4</option>
    <option value="5">Option 5</option>
</select>
```

## Event Hooks
Plugin uses both generic events and custom events. All events triggered in *uxrSelect* namespace. Rather than firing a function/method via callback you can attach your own method to plugin events.

```js
$('.select').on('uxrselect.uxrSelect', function(){
    form.submit(); // any method, function you want to define
});
```
 
Event Name			 | &nbsp;
-------------------- | -----
uxrready             | triggers when uxrSelect binds to element for the first time
uxropen              | triggers when selection droplist opened
uxrclose             | triggers when selection droplist closed
uxrselect            | triggers when an option selected
change               | triggers when the selected option value *set* to Native select. 
uxrupdate            | triggers when plugin settings updated
uxrdestroy           | triggers when uxrSelect unbinds from the element.

All these custom events also hooked the element itself when plugin is binded, and fires the callback options when triggered. 
_Note: When you watch the `uxrselect.uxrSelect` event, you get the Native selects previous with `this.$el.value()` method. In order to get the new value, you should watch the `change.uxrSelect` or `change` events_
